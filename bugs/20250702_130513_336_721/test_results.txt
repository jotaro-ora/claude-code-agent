Bug Fix Test Results
==================

Bug ID: 20250702_130513_336_721
Date: 2025-07-02
Status: FIXED

## Problem Description
The original code had a syntax error on line 12 where the docstring was not properly quoted. The function definition was missing the opening triple quotes (""") for the docstring, causing a SyntaxError during compilation.

Error message:
"SyntaxError: invalid syntax (fixed_script_tlqis50_.py, line 12)"
Line 12 contained: "Fetch OHLC data from CoinGecko API with flexible intervals and pagination."

## Root Cause
Missing opening triple quotes for the docstring in the get_coingecko_ohlc function.

## Fix Applied
1. Added opening triple quotes (""") after the function definition
2. Added closing triple quotes (""") after the docstring content
3. Preserved all existing functionality and code logic

## Testing Results

### Syntax Validation
✅ PASS: Code compiles without syntax errors
✅ PASS: Python module can be imported successfully
✅ PASS: No syntax warnings or errors

### Code Structure Verification
✅ PASS: Function signatures preserved
✅ PASS: All imports intact
✅ PASS: Main function logic unchanged
✅ PASS: Docstring properly formatted

### Minimal Change Verification
✅ PASS: Only 2 lines modified (added docstring quotes)
✅ PASS: No functional changes made
✅ PASS: Original user intent preserved

## API Dependencies
Note: This code requires CoinGecko Pro API access. The fix resolves the syntax error, but actual functionality would require:
- Valid CoinGecko Pro API key
- Network connectivity
- Required Python packages (requests, pandas)

## Success Criteria Met
1. ✅ Code runs without errors in the reported scenario
2. ✅ No regressions in existing functionality  
3. ✅ Code changes are minimal and focused
4. ✅ Original user intent is preserved
5. ✅ Syntax error completely resolved

## Conclusion
The bug has been successfully fixed. The syntax error was resolved by properly formatting the docstring with triple quotes. The code now compiles and imports without errors. All original functionality is preserved.
